### Welcome to the Git World of Philip Collier ðŸ‘‹

Here is where I keep the core of my large and small computing projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Skywave Linux], a bootable live Linux environment for global and borderless access to over the air broadcast media.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Catbird Linux], a bootable live Linux environment for content creation, web scraping, data analysis, writing, and note taking.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [MOFO Linux], a bootable live Linux environment for global and borderless access to multimedia, forums, and cypher spaces.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently creating written content for [AB9IL.net] and videos for [Mach 7 Radio Intercepts].
- ðŸ‘¯ I am writing about [KiwiSDR for online shortwave radio], [RTL-SDRs for airband radio], plus [defeating censorship and information warfare].

### Welcome to the Git World of Philip Collier ðŸ‘‹

Here is where I keep the core of my large and small computing projects.

- :angry: If you haven't already, expedite your ass out for your vaccinations.  Wear a fookin' mask.  Stay alive and don't infect _me_.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Skywave Linux], [Catbird Linux], and [MOFO Linux], plus creating content for [AB9IL.net] and [Mach 7 Radio Intercepts].
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to apply Python, Go, and Bash programming in software defined radio and data science.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about radio; been a licensed ham since 1978 [callsigns KA3BVX, KG2DH, AB9IL] and commercially licensed since the early 2000s.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about aviation; been a licensed pilot since 1985.  Type rated and experienced Boeing 767, 757, and 737 captain.  By the way, the airline industry is in terrible condition - a rust belt industry dressed in shiny aluminum and glass.  Run like hell if you can.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Right here on Github.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Some people relax with music, others enjoy art.  A few abuse substances.  I collect pictures of pigeons.  If I'm ever having a bad day, I think of the pigeons and how there's a place in the world for even those little, but magnificent, creatures.  If they have a place, then so do I (and so do you).  Matthew chapter 6.
